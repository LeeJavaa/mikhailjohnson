      "\"Foolish Vibes. Golden Times.\" is the self proclaimed motto of the social club in the heart of Stellenbosch, South Africa. Fool's Gold is one of the most popular destinations in town, one of the reasons for that being the magnificent interior design that everyone else is still trying to catch up to. Mikhail undertook installation art for Fool's gold, at it's official launch (creating the eye catching disco ball hands) as well as a few months later when a DJ area was added (courtesy of Mikhail).",
